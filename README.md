# SimpleJavaCRUD
A Simple CRUD in Java, without external libs, created to study some very important concepts like Servlets, MVC and Http.

# Project
This project was developed based on [Alura](https://github.com/alura) Servlet courses, and it's my first Java Web project. The course focus in learn some basics concepts like Servlets, MVC and Http.
Database and security are not the focus in this project, so it is oversimplified.
